RAR contains the Unity Project for importing in Unity Game Engine.
ZIP contains the Built exe for checking out the final product in action.


Additionally, some points that need to be mentioned:

To Change the grid size, you may do so by 
1. Selecting the Grid under Canvas.
2. Finding the Height and Width Fields in the Inspector.
3. Entering the desired values.
4. Run.

Also, Rotate operation may sometimes only work when the object is hovering over the grid. Be sure to try that if it isn't working.

Item will be swapped if only one item (currently on the grid) is being replaced by the item in hand. If one tries to replace two or more items by the item in hand, then it won't be allowed.

Thanks For this opportunity!
